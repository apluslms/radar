    It is not recommended to change these settings manually.
    Preferably, you should add all Radar settings directly into the configuration files for each exercise and import the whole course from the configure page on the course front page in Radar.
    Then, these settings will be configured automatically through the API of the data provider (e.g. A+).

    <h4>Exercise template</h4>
    <p>
    The exercise template will be tokenized using the tokenizer specified for this exercise.
    The resulting syntax tokens will be stored but the input template source will be <strong>discarded</strong>.
    Therefore, it is not recommended to input the template from here.
    Preferably, you should specify the template in the exercise configuration file, which allows Radar to fetch the template source from the data provider (e.g. A+).

        <p><strong>Warning</strong></p>
        <p>The exercise has a template consisting of the tokens: <code>{{ template_tokens }}</code>, but the original template source could not be retrieved using the data provider API.
        If you save this template now, the tokenized template will be overwritten with an empty template.
        This will not prevent from matching submissions, but would likely lead to an increase in the amount of matches, since also template code is included in the matches.</p>

    Every possible pair of submissions are then compared for similarities.

    The submissions will be gradually reloaded from the provider and then tokenized and matched.</p>
    <p>The amount of time required is slightly more than in <strong>Recompare all</strong>, since all submissions are first loaded from the provider API, tokenized from scratch, and then compared.</p>

    This does not delete anything from the data provider.
    In other words, if you delete this exercise and it still exists in e.g. A+, you can re-fetch the exercise and its submissions using the course configure view.
